# Topic

This is an analysis of Tiger Woods and his statistics collected from PGA Tour events this year.

# Motivation

As a member of the Harvard Men's Golf Team, I have a deep passion for the game. Since Tiger Woods is one of the most famous athletes in the world, I wanted to see what parts of his game led to the tremendous come-back season he had this year. I was most curious to track certain statistics that excellent golfers perform well on throughout all of his starts.
