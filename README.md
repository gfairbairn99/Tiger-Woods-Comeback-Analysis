# Tiger-Woods-Comeback-Analysis


### Topic

This year Tiger Woods completed perhaps the greatest comeback in sports history. After numerious career ending incidents and injuries, he managed to find his 80th career victory. This is an analysis of Tiger Woods and his statistics collected from PGA Tour events this year.

### Motivation

As a member of the Harvard Men's Golf Team, I have a deep passion for the game of golf. Since Tiger Woods is one of the most famous athletes in the world, I wanted to see what parts of his game led to the tremendous comeback season he had this year. I was most curious to see which his strongest statistics were throughout all of his starts since I wasn't following him back in his prime years.

### Background Info

The following are links that are useful to those who are unfamiliar with basic information about the game, golf related 
terminology, and Tiger's history in the sport:

### Summary

I analyzed these data in three main ways. First, I vizualized tiger's shot data to show the frequency of distances he had for each tournament. By judging these results in relationship to how well he played, the data suggests that Tiger plays some of his best golf when he isn't hitting the ball the furthest he can. Perhaps laying back on distance helps him hit more fairways, thus giving him more opportunities to hit greens and make birdies. Second, when graphing tournament scoring average by date, a clear trend appears. As the year progressed, Tiger's scoring average continued to drop. This ultimately culminated in his victory at the final event of the year. Lastly, Tiger had an amazing ball striking year. To show this, I created an interactive table to show Tiger's best shots from various distances. Most famously in this table is Tiger's wedge shot on the 11th hole at the Memorial Tournament presented by Nationwide.
